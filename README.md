# Monsters

This repo contains code to illustrate the mechanics of object-oriented
programming in Python.

There are twelve versions of essentially the same short program that simulates
a world of fighting monsters.

Each version is slightly different to the previous one, with `monsters01.py`
containing no object-oriented code, and `monsters12.py` being an idiomatic
example of object-oriented Python.

Starting with `monsters01.py` and working up to `monsters12.py`, compare each
version with the one before it to work out what has changed.
